# PyLabirintProject
MIPT 1-st semester 1-st python console project (author: Bunin Kirill)
This is my labirint project. My online poster MIPT account is Bunin.ka@phystech.edu .
1) This game will create random labirint, player-turtle and target-turtle (and some elements of decore). Target of the game is touching a target-turtle by player-turtle. You can controll player by pushing Up Down Left and Right (or A, S, D, F) buttons. When you will touch your goal, program will reload this game with another random labirint, using randomised algorithm of Cruscal.
2) This project contains just 1 python file (called: Labirint3_0.py) and 1 sound file (called: Dubsleep.mp3). Default python has all modules I import in this file, except pygame, so all you need to see what I made, is to run the game with installed pygame liborary. Do not forget about sound file. It must be put in the same directory, as .py file and it's name has to be "Dubsleep.mp3".
3) Good luck in checking my project, Sir.
