# PyLabirintProject
MIPT 1 semester python project (author: Bunin Kirill)
This is my labirint project. My online poster mipt account is Bunin.ka@phystech.edu .
1) This game will create random labirint, player-cube and target-cube. Target of the game is touching a target-cube by player-cube. You can controll player by pushing Up Down Left and Right buttons. When you will touch your goal, program will reload this game with another random labirint.
2) This project contains just 1 pythin file (.py). Default python has all modules I import in this file, so all you need to run the game, is run this code in PyCharm.
3) Good luck in checking my project
